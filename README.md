# Lights Out

## About 👾🧩📱

* This project is a replica of the classic *Lights Out* game
* It was built using JavaScript and PHP
* The PHP handled the logic to start the game while the JavaScript handled the actual game and display logic
* The board design was originally set up using and ajax request to get the board size and which tiles to randomly light up from the PHP code using JSON
* The board was updated with user interactions using jQuery in the JavaScript Code

## How to Play 🟦 🟧 🟦
* You can go the [following site](https://cs4640.cs.virginia.edu/dda5us/hw7/) where it is hosted
* Then you can choose how large to make the square board
* For every tile you click, it will flip the light switch of all the adjacent tiles to it
* Your goal is to turn OFF all the lights (make all the tiles dark blue)
* Good Luck and Enjoy!
